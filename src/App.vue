        from its "Annual Census" - an extensive survey of data visualization
        practitioners. The survey included responses from 1,766 people. As a newcomer
        to the field myself, I wanted to dive into the data to understand who
        are the people doing visualization in terms of demographics, where do they
        work and what do they study.

        Let`s look at 100 dots, with one dot representing one per cent of all
        respondents â€” approximately 18 people.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step2">
        Slightly more than half of all people who answered the survey live in
        either the United States, the United Kingdom, or Canada.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step3">
        The other half of respondents reported that they live in approximately
        80 different countries from all over the world:
        <span class="europe">Europe</span>,
        <span class="asia">Asia and Oceania</span>,
        <span class="latAm"> Latin America and the Caribbean</span>,
       and <span class ="africa">Africa</span>.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step4">
        Most of the respondents are relatively new in the data visualization world.
        Approximately one in seven respondents said that they have been doing data
        visualization for 5 years or less.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step5">
        Around half of all respondents reported having obtained a Master degree
        (or its equivalent) and 15 per cent reported having obtained a PhD.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step6">
        Degrees in science, math and technology are  the most popular ones
        among the data visualization practitioners, followed by degrees in arts
        and humanities, and social sciences.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step7">
        15% of all respondents are working in the <span class="private"> private sector. </span> Those who majored
        in business or science, math and technology ar more likely than respondents
        who pursued other degrees to work in the private sector.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step8">
        One in ten respondents is working in the <span class="public">public sector. </span> Respondents
        who specialized in social sciences are more likely than respondents who hold
        other degrees to work in the public sector.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step9">
        One in ten respondents is working in
        <span class="nonProfit"> non-profit sector.</span> Those respondents who
        have degrees in arts and humanities, as well as in social sciences are
        slightly more likely to work in non-profit sector.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step10">
    Overall, half of respondents identified as <span class="men"> men, </span> while 40% identified
        <span class="women"> women, </span> and 8 per cent identified as
        <span class="other"> non-binary. </span> There are twice as many men as
        women who had a business degree, as well as science, math and technology
        degree. The gender distribution is more equal among respondents who had
        degrees in social sciences and arts and humanities.
        </section>
  <section class="step" id="step11">
    The vast majority of all respondents learnt data visualization by themselves, without
    attending a specialized education in data visualization.
        </section>
  <section class="step" id="step12">
      The largest share of respondents reported an annual salary ranging between
      60,000 and 70,000 USD.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step13">
        While <span class="men"> men </span> and
        <span class="women"> women </span> reported approximately similar
        salaries, the share of men was higher among those respondents who
        reported an annual salary of more than 120,000 USD.
      </section>
      <section class="step" id="step14">
        Around 30 per cent of respondents who reported their annual salary between
        100,000 and 140,00 USD said that data visualization was the <span class="main"> main focus </span>
        of their job, a slightly higher share than those who said data
        visualization was their
        <span class="secondary"> secondary </span> focus or <span class="neither">
       neither primary or secondary  </span> focus.

      Education degrees are recoded as follows: in a person finished Master
      degree, specialization for a Master degree was used, but if a person only
      finished Bachelor degree, specialization for the Bachelor degree was
      taken. <br />
